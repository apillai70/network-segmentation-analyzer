## 5 Files That Have Been Fixed

Copy these files from AjayPillai to RC34361 directory:

1. **generate_docs_auto.py**
2. **generate_network_segmentation_single.py**
3. **generate_solution_design_single.py**
4. **generate_threat_surface_single.py**
5. **generate_all_docs_for_apps.py**

## What Was Fixed

- Topology loading now checks master_topology.json FIRST (has all 167 apps)
- sys.executable bug fixed (was using wrong Python)
- Timeout increased to 30 minutes
- Better error reporting

```bash
python generate_docs_auto.py --types netseg
```
